As experienced electrophysiologist, I've performed recordings on several _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ models:

- Rodent hippocampal slices.
- Rodent head-fixated acute models.
- Rodent free-moving chronic models.
- NHPs head-fixated chronic models.

The range of projects I've been involved in covers:

- Non-NMDA hippocampal plasticity mechanisms.
- NMDA-dependent early/long term potentiation on in vivo models.
- Anesthesia induction and recovery dynamics on NHPs. 

Please, have a look to my Scholar site for a detailed list of publications.
